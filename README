Library for the locomotion of modular snake robots
------------------------------------------------------

This library has been tested using the skymega board, which is arduino compatible

-> In thingiverse (English)
  http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:14197

-> Iearobotics (Spanish)
  http://www.iearobotics.com/wiki/index.php?title=SkyMega

INSTALLATION
------------

The current version is being developed under Arduino 22 IDE

* Copy the folder ArduSnake under the sketchbook/libraries arduino folder
  (it is located in your home directory)

* If you are using the skymega board instead of an Arduino, copy the
  folder skymega folder under home/sketchbook/libraries

HELLO WORLD EXAMPLE
-------------------

This example just makes oscillate a servo connected to the pin 8 (SERVO 2
in the skymega board)

* Connect the servo to the board (Skymega/Arduino)
* Open de Arduino IDE
* Go to File/examples/ArduSnake/Oscillator_test1
* Download the example
* The servo will star to oscillate!
